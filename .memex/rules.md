# Project Rules

## Git Workflow
- Don't commit unless told to
- If told to commit: check status, add files, and commit
- Don't merge or push changes unless told to

## File Editing
- Always perform precise file editing with search/replace format
- Use SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for all file changes
- Ensure SEARCH blocks exactly match existing content

## Image Sizing
- Dashboard tiles: 280px height for containers
- Images: 260px max-height
- Social share image: 1200x630px (1.91:1 aspect ratio)

## Loading States
- Show loading spinners for APOD and Mars tiles
- Let leaflet handle its own loading for ISS map
- Keep loading states consistent across similar components

## Meta Tags
- Use GitHub raw URLs for static assets
- Include OpenGraph and Twitter card meta tags
- Maintain proper social preview dimensions
